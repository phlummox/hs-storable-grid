# storable-grid

Allows a vector-of-vectors view of a block of
contiguous foreign data.

Supports a few vector operations for convenience.

Status: experimental. Seems to work, but I offer no guarantees, nor
promises to support.

Most documentation is in the src/Data/Grid/Storable.hs file,
and the tests/ directory gives some sample usage.

Should work with Stack LTS 3 and onward.
